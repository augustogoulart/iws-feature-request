# IWS Feature Request App

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/augustogoulart/iws-feature-request.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/augustogoulart/iws-feature-request)

### Update
Up to this moment, the app is running on an AWS EC2 instance at http://ec2-54-191-66-93.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:5000/

This is not the first release yet, since all we have is a Flask application serving a static page, 
but is the end of the first delivery cycle. Here the process of design -> code -> deploy reaches the final stage 
for the first time during the project's development stage.
